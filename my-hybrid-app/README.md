# SmartBite - Food Sharing Platform

Submitted for KITAHACK 2026 - Google Developer Groups Hackathon

## Overview

SmartBite is a mobile application that connects food donors with recipients to reduce food waste and help communities in need. The platform enables users to share surplus food, discover nearby available items, and get AI-powered recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.

## Addressing SDG 2: Zero Hunger

This project directly contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 - Zero Hunger. SmartBite tackles food insecurity and waste through:

- **Reducing Food Waste** - Preventing edible surplus food from going to landfills by connecting donors with those who need it
- **Improving Food Access** - Providing a platform for communities to access nutritious food that would otherwise be discarded
- **Promoting Food Security** - Enabling efficient redistribution of food resources to address hunger in local communities
- **Maximizing Food Utilization** - AI-powered recipe suggestions help users make the most of available ingredients, reducing waste while ensuring nutritious meals

By leveraging technology to bridge the gap between food surplus and food scarcity, SmartBite works toward a future where no one goes hungry while addressing the global food waste crisis.

## Key Features

## Google Technologies Used

This project leverages Google technologies as required for KITAHACK 2026:

- **Flutter Framework** - Used to build the entire mobile application frontend, powering all user interfaces including the welcome screen, dashboards, food upload forms, recipe browsers, QR scanner, and AI recipe generator. Flutter enables smooth cross-platform development with a single codebase for both Android and iOS.

- **Google AI Studio (Gemini API)** - Integrated in the backend AI service to provide intelligent recipe suggestions. The Gemini 2.5 Flash model analyzes user-provided ingredients, dietary preferences, and cuisine types to generate detailed recipes with cooking instructions, ingredient measurements, preparation times, and helpful cooking tips.
